## What is AsyncAPI?

AsyncAPI is an open-source initiative that provides a specification for defining and documenting your event-driven APIs (just like Swagger and OpenAPI do for REST APIs). The specification is protocol-agnostic, so you can use it with MQTT, WebSockets, AMQP, and any other messaging protocol. The main goal of AsyncAPI is to make event-driven architectures as easy to understand and use as REST ones [support.smartbear.com](https://support.smartbear.com/swaggerhub/docs/tutorials/writing-asyncapi-tutorial.html).
